# College Graduation Correlation Analysis

## Project Overview:

As a first-generation college student, the choice of a university involves considering various factors. However, one aspect often overlooked is the graduation rate. This project stems from a personal curiosity: What state has the highest college graduation rate per high school graduate? The focus is on exploring the correlation between a state's high school and college graduates. Does the state of attendance or the state of origin matter more when students choose colleges? Our nation witnesses a significant number of high school graduates not attending college, and many incoming freshmen struggle to complete their degrees. The potential consequence of this trend is a decline in the number of college-educated young adults entering the workforce. To address this issue, the project aims to understand the correlation between high school graduation rates, the enrollment of first-year college students, and college graduation rates.

## Approach to Problem Statement:

To address the problem, state-specific data on high school and college graduation rates, along with incoming first-year college students, will be collected. The approach involves two key parts:

1. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Examining the correlation between high school graduates immediately starting college per state.
   - Analyzing the correlation to identify states with the highest scores based on different criteria.

2. **Analysis of Incoming First-Year Students:**
   - Investigating the relationship between incoming first-year college students and subsequent college graduation rates per state.

## Data Collection:

Data has been collected for each state in three areas: high school graduation rates, first-year college student enrollment, and college graduation rates. This comprehensive dataset will form the basis for the analysis.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
