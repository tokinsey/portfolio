# Dataset Analysis for Death Rates and Suicides

## Project Overview:
This Python project is designed to analyze datasets related to death rates and suicides, focusing on various demographic factors such as age, race, sex, and Hispanic origin. The goal is to provide insights into the patterns and trends associated with mortality and suicides within different population segments.

## Features:
1. Data Import and Preprocessing:
	Utilizes Pandas for efficient data manipulation and cleaning.
	Handles missing or inconsistent data to ensure the accuracy of analysis.

2. Descriptive Statistics:
	Generates descriptive statistics for key variables to understand the overall distribution.

3. Demographic Analysis:
	Segregates data based on age, race, sex, and Hispanic origin.
	Visualizes demographic-specific trends using matplotlib and seaborn.

4. Death Rates Analysis:
	Calculates death rates per population segment.
	Identifies outliers and anomalies in death rates.

5. Suicide Rates Analysis:
	Examines suicide rates across different demographic groups.
	Provides visualizations to highlight variations and patterns.

6. Correlation Analysis:
	Investigates potential correlations between demographic factors and death/suicide rates.
	Utilizes statistical methods to quantify relationships.
