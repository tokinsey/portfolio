# Leveraging Social Media and Influencers for Business Growth

## Business Problem:

This project evaluates the benefits of incorporating social media platforms and influencer partnerships for advertising and sales for potential business growth. Specifically, it seeks to establish whether participation in social media strategies and collaboration with influencers can increase brand visibility, and engagement, ultimately boosting sales. 

## Dataset Overview:

For this project, we will utilize 3 data sources. The first is the online influencers' marketing data from Data World, which provides insights into how users respond to the question, "What do you think when an influencer is selling a product?". The second dataset is the Social Influence on Shopping dataset, also from Data World. Collected through our social survey mobile platform, goodly, this dataset comprises responses from 300,000 millennials and Gen Z members, totaling 150,000,000 survey responses to date. It showcases user input on the question, "What social platform has influenced your online shopping?". The final dataset is a brief survey result that gives the age, estimated income, and whether they have purchased from any social media site before.

- Do influencers help in selling products.
