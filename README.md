Project 1: Dataset Analysis for Death Rates and Suicides
Description: This Python project is designed to analyze datasets related to death rates and suicides, focusing on various demographic factors such as age, race, sex, and Hispanic origin. The goal is to provide insights into the patterns and trends associated with mortality and suicides within different population segments.

Project 2: Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Data Analysis
Description: This Python project is dedicated to the analysis of datasets related to electric vehicles (BEVs) and hybrid vehicles. The analysis delves into various aspects, including BEV and hybrid registrations, state populations, and gas consumption. The primary objective is to extract valuable insights into adoption trends and patterns, addressing challenges and ethical considerations associated with the data.

Project 3: Employee Attrition Data Mining Project
Description: This data mining project focuses on analyzing employee data to understand the factors contributing to employee attrition within a company. High attrition rates can adversely affect workflow, productivity, and incur unnecessary training and recruitment costs. The goal is to uncover patterns and relationships in historical data, including demographics, position characteristics, and compensation, to identify the drivers of attrition. By gaining insights from this analysis, companies can proactively address issues and implement targeted interventions to improve employee retention

Project 4: College Graduation Correlation Analysis
Description: As a first-generation college student, the choice of a university involves considering various factors. However, one aspect often overlooked is the graduation rate. This project stems from a personal curiosity: What state has the highest college graduation rate per high school graduate? The focus is on exploring the correlation between a state's high school and college graduates. Does the state of attendance or the state of origin matter more when students choose colleges? Our nation witnesses a significant number of high school graduates not attending college, and many incoming freshmen struggle to complete their degrees. The potential consequence of this trend is a decline in the number of college-educated young adults entering the workforce. To address this issue, the project aims to understand the correlation between high school graduation rates, the enrollment of first-year college students, and college graduation rates.

Project 5: Meat Imports and Domestic Production Analysis Project
Description: This project proposal outlines a comprehensive plan for analyzing meat imports and domestic production in the United States. The primary objective is to gather data on various meat types, including beef, pork, fish, and poultry, imported into the United States and assess it in conjunction with the quantity of domestically produced meat. Through the analysis of trends, patterns, and variations in domestic and imported production, this project aims to provide significant insights into the meat industry.

Project 6: Elevating Safety: Traveling in Safe Hands
Description: This project aims to assure the audience about airline safety through a 3-minute movie, blog post, and executive presentation. The diliverables of this project were ensured through a Power BI dashboard explaining the data behind multiple incidences. Furthermore, this project aims to show how the public can be notified.

Project 7: Movie Recommendation Generator
Description: This movie recommendation generator is built on user input and utilizes a dataset labeled as Data1. The process involves calculating movie similarities based on user interactions. The dataset is loaded into Python as Data1, and a matrix is created to calculate cosine similarity between movies paired with user ratings. The recommendation generator function, get_rec, is designed to provide movie recommendations based on a chosen movieId from Data1.

Project 8: Hydraulic System Preventative Measures Project
Description: The core objective of this project is to minimize downtime and curb maintenance costs within hydraulic solutions. The endeavor addresses these challenges through the development of a robust predictive model with advanced condition monitoring. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights that optimize maintenance schedules by predicting failures and enhance the reliability of the hydraulic system.
