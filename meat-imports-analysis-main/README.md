# Meat Imports and Domestic Production Analysis Project

## Project Overview:

This project proposal outlines a comprehensive plan for analyzing meat imports and domestic production in the United States. The primary objective is to gather data on various meat types, including beef, pork, fish, and poultry, imported into the United States and assess it in conjunction with the quantity of domestically produced meat. Through the analysis of trends, patterns, and variations in domestic and imported production, this project aims to provide significant insights into the meat industry.

## Key Questions to Address:

1. **Meat Imports Over Time:**
   - How have the quantities of meat imports into the United States changed over time?

2. **Trends and Patterns:**
   - Are there any trends or patterns showing in domestic meat production and meat imports over the years?

3. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Is there a correlation between changes in domestic meat production and meat import quantities?

4. **Proportion of Imports by Meat Type:**
   - Which meat type has the highest proportion of imports? Which has the lowest?

5. **Proportion of Domestic Production by Meat Type:**
   - Which meat type has the highest proportion of domestic production? Which has the lowest?

6. **Correlation between Highest/Lowest Proportions:**
   - Is there a correlation between the highest and lowest of each, showing that one moves relative to the other?

## Project Challenges:
After the initial analysis, it's acknowledged that answering question number 3 regarding the correlation between domestic meat production changes and meat import quantities may pose challenges. Further exploration and statistical methodologies will be employed to address this specific question.
