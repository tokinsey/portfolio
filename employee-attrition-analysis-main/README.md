# Employee Attrition Data Mining Project

## Project Overview:

This data mining project focuses on analyzing employee data to understand the factors contributing to employee attrition within a company. High attrition rates can adversely affect workflow, productivity, and incur unnecessary training and recruitment costs. The goal is to uncover patterns and relationships in historical data, including demographics, position characteristics, and compensation, to identify the drivers of attrition. By gaining insights from this analysis, companies can proactively address issues and implement targeted interventions to improve employee retention.

## Features:

### Data Import and Preprocessing:

- Utilizes Pandas for efficient data manipulation and cleaning.
- Addresses issues such as missing values, incorrect formatting, and outliers for accurate analysis.

### Descriptive Statistics:

- Generates descriptive statistics to gain a comprehensive understanding of key variables.

### Demographic Analysis:

- Segregates data based on demographic factors, exploring patterns across different groups.
- Utilizes matplotlib and seaborn for visualizing demographic-specific trends.

### Attrition Analysis:

- Examines historical data to understand the reasons behind employee attrition.
- Identifies patterns and relationships in factors such as demographics, position characteristics, and compensation.
